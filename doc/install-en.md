Kaip Zubko!
Read as "File sharing like Zubko" in English. Or "File sharing Zubko way". (Zubko is a surname; most probably with roots from Ukraine).

It's a next generation of distributed file sharing. Forget about torrents (and they smell like crime, right?). Now you have many smart gadgets and first of all you want to share file between them. Want to see a movie from your laptop on smart TV? Do you know how to set up a home wireless network considering your laptop runs Windows, you have iPhone in your pocket and you have a Linux based smart TV (like most of us)? We haven't learned it yet therefore "Kaip Zubko!" project began. Pardon, it's a lie, it actually began because we want to share files between a distributed team of people. But first learn how to share files across your devices and then you can easily switch to team sharing.

"Kaip Zubko!" wants to tell you that file sharing via cloud is easier. Even easier than setting up home network. But make sure you have a stable Internet plan so you get a fixed pay check at the end of the month.

To use "Kaip Zubko!" you'll need to set up a cloud web site. Then you'll install "Kaip Zubko!" application to it. Sounds difficult? We'll show that it's not. Or ask your 13 years old son to do it for you.

STEP 0. Get a Google account
Get a gmail e-mail address. If you have one then skip this step.
Go to https://accounts.google.com and register your account. You'll need a mobile phone able to get SMS to enter it somewhere (no need for smart phone).

STEP 1. Set up your cloud web application
Go to https://appengine.google.com and register. You'll need a mobile phone able to get SMS to enter it somewhere (no need for smart phone).
Once you can login to https://appengine.google.com, create your application. You have to choose an unique application identifier. Of course, try mykaipzubko first, but if it's taken select another one. Say, mykaipzubko.appspot.com is a place you've got (replace mykaipzubko with your true app id further on).
