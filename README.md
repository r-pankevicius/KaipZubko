Soon (just in few years) this project (stolen from Sergey Burma) may become a drop box for teams. May. Because it's May now.

###### About


###### Demo
See how HTML 5 compliant [Admin UI gracefully falls back to classic HTML on legacy browsers](http://kaipzubko.appspot.com/get/5639445604728832/admin-ui-v1.png).

###### Status
  1 new commiter in the opening day. 12 active users. Weekend ahead so it should be calm and cool. Login conf in Vilnius - we expect to get more cash but we don't know what to do with it yet. I opt to reject it: They will dictate the rulez, I don't want it (yet). We need to sit dow and think where we want to go. I don't want to code for food here, in this place.

###### Roadmap
+ Cache headers
- Split this file: for developers and jump-in users.
- ...
- Add Commiters.txt
- Add "publishers" by email.
- Next target to steal REST API from: https://github.com/protomouse/appengine-filestore
