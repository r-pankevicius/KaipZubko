Next generation of distributed file sharing.

###### About
File sharing solution for the teams. (We target developer teams at the current state.)

###### Demo (Live!)
See how HTML 5 compliant [Admin UI gracefully falls back to classic HTML on legacy browsers](http://kaipzubko.appspot.com/get/5639445604728832/admin-ui-v1.png).

###### Uniqueness (compared to our CDN competitors et al.)
You can change file name you access and get.

For teams:
If you get a link http://host/get/123456/hot-chick.jpg but you work for a serious company then edit it and get http://host/get/123456/system-architecture.jpg. You'll get the same file.

For business: If you're serving vanilla-js.1.0.js framework and your product owners want your customers to upgrade to vanilla-js.1.1.js but you're not ready... just change a link from http://cdnhost/get/123456/vanilla-js.1.0.js to vanilla-js.1.1.js.

###### Status
  1 new commiter in the opening day. 12 active users. Weekend ahead so it should be calm and cool.
  
###### Roadmap
- Split this file: for developers and jump-in users.
- ...
- Add "publishers" by email.
- Next target to steal REST API from: https://github.com/protomouse/appengine-filestore
