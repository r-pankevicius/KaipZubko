### Kaip Zubko!

Next generation of distributed file sharing.

Developers can jump to [quick install guide](./doc/install-en.md).

###### Demo (Live!)
See how HTML 5 compliant [Admin UI gracefully falls back to classic HTML on legacy browsers](http://kaipzubko.appspot.com/5639445604728832/admin-ui-v1.png).

###### Uniqueness (compared to our CDN competitors et al.)
You can change file name you access and get.

For teams:
If you get a link from friends like <code>http://kaipzubkoteamhost/123456/hot-chick.jpg</code> but you work for a serious company then edit it and get <code>http://kaipzubkoteamhost/123456/system-architecture-draft-1.jpg</code>. You'll get the same file.

For business: If you're serving vanilla-js.1.0.js framework and your product owners want your customers to upgrade to vanilla-js.1.1.js but you're not ready... just change a link from <code>http://kaipzubkocdnhost/123456/vanilla-js.1.0.js</code> to vanilla-js.1.1.js.
